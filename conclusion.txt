One of the conclusions I came too was that images with low contrast appear to have a low variance
Another conlusion is that images with low contrast also have a small standard deviation
This implies that images with low contrast appear to not divert from the mean very much and tend to be
be stable if you will,  in their intensity levels.

I'm not sure if this all was exactly what you were looking for or if my code even meets the criteria
for a good grade but I hope it does. I think I have performed all of the requested actions in the 
assignment
